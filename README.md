<h1>MoreFabricFood</h1>
MoreFabricFood is a Minecraft Mod for the Fabric Mod Loader that adds new food to the game. I'm working on it in my free time but at the moment the mod is far from finished. But don't expect it to be finished in the near future because I'm just one person who doesn't always want to code and doesn't have endless free time either.
