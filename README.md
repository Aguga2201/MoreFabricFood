<h1>MoreFabricFood</h1>
MoreFabricFood is a Minecraft Mod for the Fabric Mod Loader that adds new food to the game. I'm working on it in my free time but at the moment the mod is far from finished. But don't expect it to be finished in the near future because I'm just one person who doesn't always want to code and doesn't have endless free time either.

<h1>How to play:</h1>
<h3>Prebuild Packages</h3>
Not available yet because the mod isn't even in beta yet.
<h3>Build from source</h3>
Requirements: </br>
-Windows, Mac or Linux </br>
-<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea/download/">IntelliJ IDEA Community</a> </br>

1.: Download the source code. </br>
2.: Open IntelliJ, click on "Open", choose the source directory and Click on "Ok" </br>
3.: Gradle Build process should automatically start. Wait until it's finished. If you can't see the process click on "Build" at the bottom. If it says build failed, that's fine for now. </br>
4.: Click on "File" in the upper left corner and click on "Project Structure". </br>
5.: Select your JDK at the "SDK" field and set "Language Level" to 17. Then click on "Ok" at the bottom. </br>
6.: Click on the vertical "Gradle" button at the upper right corner. First click on the arrow next to "MoreFabricFood". Now click on the arrow next to "Task" and then on the arrow next to "build" now double click on the "build" option. </br>
7.: Open your file manager and go to the MoreFabricFood directory. Then go to the "build" folder and then to the "libs" folder. You can now use the jar file without "sources" at the end like any normal mod. </br> </br>
If you aren't sure how to install the mod jar look at the prebuild section.
